# Injury prediction
This project involves the development and deployment of a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of injury for athletes based on various factors such as age, weight, previous injuries, training intensity, and recovery time. The model was trained using a Random Forest algorithm and evaluated for accuracy and performance. The model is saved and can be used for future predictions. A Plumber API was implemented to serve the model, allowing users to interact with the system by providing input data such as player age, weight, and injury history, and receive predictions on the likelihood of injury. The project aims to assist in injury prevention by providing coaches and medical staff with data-driven insights to make informed decisions about training and player management. The API is built for easy deployment and can be accessed through simple GET requests, making it a scalable solution for real-time injury prediction.
